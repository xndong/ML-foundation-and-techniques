Increase the dimension of input features by nonlinear transform. Thus, model can be more complexity.
Polynomial nonlinear tranform is a popularly used nonlinear transform. I also think there are other kinds of nonlinear transform, but they will not be considered here.

Note that overfit can emerge when using nonlinear transform. So, regularization is necessary. Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet are popularly used regularization items.
